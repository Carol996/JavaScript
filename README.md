JavaScript Projects

In this repository, I have a series of small projects using JavaScript that show the use of differnt JS functions, methods, operators, etc. 

Here's a brief description of each:

- Asynch_Assignment: code demonstrating ansynchronous operations, debugging, and defering.

- Calculator: a fully functional basic calculator.

- HTML Elements: a method creating an element within an HTML doc.

- Pizza Project: a page where the user can place a pizza order, pick from different toppings, and find out their total price.

- Project 1 through 10: Individual documents showcasing the functionality of some of the basic actions that can take place in JS. 

- Tic Tac Toe: a fully functional game

- Final Challenges: A set of individual documents showcasing a few more actions that can take place within JS and how they affect a given HTML doc. 


Additionally, I've added a React and jQuery folder where the use and functionality of each is showcased.
