there is a function called 'get_todos', this function is composed of two variables
first variable 'todos' equals to whatever array of tasks are inputted by the user. This variable is commanded to CREATE a new array.
second variable 'todos_str' is whatever string was stored temporarily in the browser
if todos_str doesn't equal to null, meaning if there's a string present as a 'todo' item, then...
...that 'todo' item --represented as a string, should be parsed into a JS object; this happens using a JSON method.

the function get_todos will return whatever 'todos' is, after going through the parse process above.


there is a new function called add and it has two variables
1st variable is 'task' and it's equal to wahtever value is in <input> within HTML doc
2nd variable is 'todos' and it's equivalent to the function above, get_todos

here we ask variable 'todos' to add a new task at the end of the array created above
then we ask the program to turn the jsobj in the browser storage into a string using JSON method...
..and show whatever is in <input>
using the 'show' function, which will be defined below
